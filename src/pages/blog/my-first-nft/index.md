His name is Tech Sam, which is short for Technological SamSquanch.

He loves Chia because it helps protect his home in the forest.

Which is why Tech Sam chose to be minted using Chia's NFT1 Standard.

I've been wanting to dip my toe into NFT's for a while now but have held off for many reasons.
The biggest reason would be that I have been mostly waiting for Chia to release their NFT standard on mainnet. As of this week, that has launched! So no more excuses... time to get my hands dirty... or toes wet, rather.
