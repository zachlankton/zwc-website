This Small Business ERP was created for a small manufacturing business, [Molded Magnesium Products, LLC](http://mmpmg.com) The bulk of the project was completed and usable in a couple months. I continue to maintain and add features as needed. This application has been successfully deployed and used since the beginning of 2022.
