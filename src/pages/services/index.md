## Web Development Services

Are you looking for someone to help you create a website or a web application?

```jsx
function AwesomeWebsite({ n }) {
  return (
    <>
      <p> I have {n} years of experience in web development </p>
    </>
  );
}

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  return { props: { n: "many" } };
}

export default AwesomeWebsite;
```

I am an expert in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I can create what you need using whatever stack you would like. It can be as simple as a handwritten page or as complex as a custom business ERP app built using the newest front-end framework and the latest flavor of SQL or NoSQL tech. No web tech too scary, No project is too big or small. [Contact me today](/contact).
