# About Me

## My name is Zach, and I love warm circuits!

### I am a problem solver of the digital kind.

For those that prefer titles, I am a _**Software Engineer.**_ I am not particularly invested in my title. For me, this title serves no purpose. I would instead like my work to speak for itself. I have expertise in _**Full Stack Web Development**_ and _**Cloud Services**_. I am comfortable with _**Networking**_ and _**System Administration**_. I dabble in _**Electrical Engineering**_ and _**Robotics**_.

### Strengths

My first strength is Prototyping. Ideas are hard to articulate at the beginning of a project. Prototyping gets a product in the end-users hands quicker and facilitates better feedback. Iterating on feedback is faster than scrapping an entire month's worth of work because of a misunderstanding. My second strength is attention to detail. I create responsive websites that look great on all screen sizes. I look for little touches that can make significant differences, like subtle box shadows or border radii.

### Weaknesses

My first weakness is Microsoft Windows. I use it every day for personal and business use. Though for web development, I am much faster and more capable of configuring a Linux box than a windows server. My second weakness is proprietary software. I've not much experience with any of it. The success of my career has been my ability to leverage open-source software to solve problems, even if that means getting my hands dirty.
