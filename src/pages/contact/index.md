# Contact Me

Looking for someone to help you with a software project? Contact Me!

Or just want to send me a message to say hi and give me some feedback? Contact Me!

But if you are a robot, please DO NOT CONTACT ME.

This form is a simple text box that will ONLY send email to me.

If you want to make sure that I can respond to you, then please leave your email or other contact info in the body of the message.

<textarea style="width: 100%; height: 300px; resize: vertical; background-color:#ffffffa6; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px 0px black; padding: 10px;" id="contact_me_message" placeholder="Type your message here, don't forget to include your email or other contact info if you want me to respond!"></textarea>

When you are ready to send this email, on the last line of your message,
type

```
SEND EMAIL
```

in all caps and press enter.

Don't worry if you make a mistake, as long as those are the last 11 characters of this message and you are a human typing in this text box, you should see "Sending Email..." appear in the text box.
